## Exam tips
#### 1. Building a scalable, fault-tolerant and cost-efficient architecture

This is the most important section of the exam as it covers 60% of the total score. Here are the top points you need to know:

**AWS EC2, Load Balancer, and Storage Options:**

In this section, the exam will question your knowledge on various topics such as the payment plans, types of storage for the instances, etc.

**Key points to remember:**

Understand the difference between the three payment plans:
* **On-Demand instances:** pay per hour

Use cases: development/ testing environment.

* **Reserved instances:** 1 or 3-year agreement (up to 60% discount)

Use cases: production-ready application, applications that will be live for a long time.

* **Spot Instances:** bid on the price

Use cases: applications that termination of an instance won’t cause an issue.

Spot Instance: If the price of the spot instance goes above the bid price, or there is not enough capacity, the AWS EC2 instance will receive a termination notice and will be terminated in two minutes.

There are three tenancy options:
* **Shared Tenancy:** Multiple instances run on the same hardware (default option)
* **Dedicated instance:** A dedicated hardware that runs only a single customer instance
* **Dedicated host:** Physical server with full EC2 capacity dedicated to the user. It’s mostly used for Licensing reasons.

Instance store data is lost when an Amazon EC2 instance is restarted or terminated. It is temporary data!

There are four types of AMI’s
* **AMI’s that are published by AWS:** These are maintained and managed by AWS and are very reliable.
* **AWS Marketplace:** You could purchase AMI’s from other providers such as Bitnami, Drupal. You don’t need to install the applications.
* **Existing Instance AMI’s:** AMI’s from a current EC2.
* **Uploaded AMI’s from Virtual Servers:**  These are AMI’s that have been Imported or Exported via AWS Import/Export Service.

**EFS** volume can be mounted on multiple servers.

**EBS** volume can be mounted on a single server.

Public IP is changed on a stop/start of an instance. To avoid the change of IP,  associate an Elastic IP to your instance.
Elastic IP attached to an EC2 instance will not incur any charge! But, if it is not associated you will be charged.

A newly launched Window Instance can be accessed via the Random Password which AWS generates upon the completion of the instance creation.

**Bootstrapping:** Allows you to execute a script when an instance is booted.  Usually, it involves installing certain packages or configuring Chef/Puppet.

**Enhanced Networking:** Is a feature in AWS EC2 which improves the network connectivity. Note: Only specific EC2 types support it and can be enabled in a VPC only.

**Termination Protection** prevents accidental deletion of an EC2 instance.

**Placement Group:**  Let’s you place multiple AWS EC2 instances in a group, this will provide a lower network latency.

There are four types of EBS Volumes:
* **Cold HDD** Use case: applications with few data access. Max IOPS 250.
* **Throughput HDD** Use case: data warehouse, log processing. Max IOPS 500.
* **General Purpose SSD** Use case: OS boot volume, databases. Max IOPS 10,000
* **Provisioned IOPS SSD** Use case: Applications which need very fast data access, large databases Max IOPS 20,000.

#### 2. AWS Databases

**OLTP** – Online Transaction Processing (database types: AWS RDS, AWS Aurora)

**OLAP** – Online Analytic Processing (AWS Redshift)

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** – the acceptable data loss.

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** – the time in future that your application can be live.

* Manual DB Snapshots are not deleted automatically compared to Automated DB Snapshots!

* To create a fault tolerant and high available database architecture, implement Multi-AZ.
Use the DNS name in your application to connect to the database. If the database fails, AWS will update the records so it won’t impact your application.

* Use Read Replicas in a heavy read traffic website.

* Use AWS Redshift bulk import command, it is much more efficient than raw SQL Queries.

* Amazon DynamoDB is the AWS Managed NoSQL database.

* Increase the write efficiency of an Amazon DynamoDB by randomizing the primary key value.

* AWS Aurora is the database engine developed by AWS which is faster and cheaper than AWS RDS.
---

#### 3. AWS Storage, S3, Glacier
This section focuses on various storage options, security of data storage and implement/deployment of storage options.

**Key points:**

* Block level (EBS) and file storage (EFS) are covered here
* AWS S3 is an object storage, everything saved in S3 is stored as data objects.
* Each object consists of a MetaData (created by Amazon) and Data (custom data).
* An object size could be from 0 to 5 TB.
* S3 Objects are replicated across multiple devices within a region!
* S3 Objects are saved in a container called “Bucket“, consider Bucket as the root folder.
* To prevent accidental object deletion, enable versioning and MFA.
* S3 data can be replicated across other regions, this is usually done for compliance. Note: Only new objects will be replicated.
* Bucket names are unique across all AWS Accounts!
* Bucket name must be between 3 and 63 characters and can contain numbers, hyphens or periods.

**Consistency Model of S3**

* When you create a new object, you will receive the latest object. (Read After Write Consistency)PUTS to new object
* When you PUT or DELETE a current object,  AWS provides Eventual consistency, it might take a while for the changes to be affected.

**There are three S3 storage classes:**
* **S3 Standard:** 99.99% availability, ideal for frequently accessed data.
* **S3 Infrequent Access:** 99.9% availability, ideal for less frequently accessed data, cheaper than S3 Standard, minimum object size 128kb
* **S3 RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage):** 99.99% availability, cheapest. ideal for objects that data loss is not important.
AWS Glacier is ideal for archiving data, data stored in Glacier is not immediately available. Retrieving data takes time.

#### 4. Elastic Load Balancer
Key points:

There are two types of load balancer:

* **Internet Facing:** has public IP
* **Internal Load Balancer:** routes traffic within a VPC)

There are three categories of Load Balancer:
* **Application Load Balancer**
  * Operates at Layer 7.
  * Supports WebSockets and Secure WebSockets.
  * Supports SNI.
  * Supports IPv6.
* **Network Load Balancer** ( The NLB is the recommended Load Balancer to be used at Layer 4)
  * Operates at Layer 4.
  * Preserves the source IP.
  * Provides reduced latency compared to other Load Balancers.
  * Handles millions of requests per seconds.
  * Classic Load Balancer
  * Operates at Layer 4.
  * Features Cross Zone Load Balancing.

* **Idle Connection Timeout:** Is the period of inactivity between the client and the EC2 instance in which the Load Balancer terminates the connection. By default, it is 60 seconds.
* Enable Cross Zone Load Balancing, to distribute traffic evenly across the pool of registered AWS instances.
* Connection Draining stops the load balancer sending traffic to faulty instances.
* **Proxy Protocol:** To receive the clients IP and User Agent, it needs to be enabled. (only on Network Load Balancer and Classic Load Balancer)
* **Sticky Sessions**: Ensures that the load balancer sends future user request to the EC2 instance that received the initial request.
* **Auto Scaling Group:** Lets you increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances based upon CPU, RAM, Scheduled Scaling (usually used when you predict that there will be an increase in load in X time ex: Marketing Campaign)

#### 5. Designing a secure VPN
In this section, the exam will test your knowledge on the security aspect of an architecture. Building a secure architecture can be a challenging job of an architect. AWS has many services or features which can help you implement a secure architecture.

**Key points to remember:**

* VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to a customer on AWS.
* VPC cannot be associated with multiple regions.
* VPC or Subnets IP address range cannot be altered once the VPC has been created.

A newly VPC created has the following resources:
* Subnets.
* Route Tables.
* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
* Security Groups.
* Network Access Control
* A subnet is segmentation of a VPC.

* The smallest subnet can have 16 (/28 netmask) IP addresses and maximum 65,536 (/16 netmask).
* 5 IP addresses of a subnet is being used by AWS, so if you create a subnet with 16 IP addresses will have only 11 IP address available to use (16-5 = 11)

There are three types of a subnet:
* **Public:** Has internet access and traffic is routed to the IGW (Internet Gateway)
* **Private:** Is not routed to the IGW.
* **VPN-only:** Traffic is directed to a VPG (Virtual Private Gateway).

* A subnet can be associated with a single availability zone!.
* For a  subnet to become public (have internet access), it would need to route its all non-local traffic to the IGW.
* VPC Endpoints lets you create an end-to-end connection from your VPC with AWS services such as S3 via a private network without the need of an internet connection, NAT Gateway etc.
* VPC peering connection, lets you connect instances from other VPC’s together.
* Connections are initiated through a request/accept protocol.
* It is a one to one relationship.
* Cannot peer VPC from different regions.
* Does not support transitive routing.

There are two types of firewalls:
* **Security Group.**
* **Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

* For instances in a private subnet that needs to access the internet, they would need to connect to a NAT instance or a NAT Gateway.
* NAT Instances are managed by the customer.
* NAT Gateway is managed by AWS and scales automatically.

#### 6. Lambda
You don’t need to manage the infrastructure for running Lambda functions. AWS handles the scaling, provisioning and the management of the servers. This does not mean AWS Lambda is like Beanstalk. 

Beanstalk is a PaaS. With Beanstalk you could push framework codes such as WordPress, Laravel, Symfony etc. AWS handles the scaling, platform patching, and more operations.

* AWS Lambda is not a replacement for Beanstalk

* Functions can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch or on the console.

* You are charged per function call. Unlike EC2 which you get charged per hour usage, Lamba is per call.

To increase the performance,  Lambda@Edge can be utilized which runs your code across AWS regions globally. This provides a faster response rate and reduced latency. If you receive a question, for example, a client is planning to utilize Lambda but has users from different regions of the world and how would you improve the performance. It is Lambda@Edge 🙂

Functions can access a single VPC not multiple.

The minimum memory is 128 MB and maximum 3008 MB. Functions will be terminated if it uses more than 3008 MB. (I don’t think the examiners will question your knowledge of memory size as it changes over the year)

The maximum duration of a function is 300 seconds i.e 5 minutes.

The functions can be written in:
* Node.js
* Python
* Java
* C#
* Go

Function access to other AWS resources can be granted by utilizing  IAM role. 

You could develop an API using the API Gateway with Lambda Proxy Integration.

If you are unsure when to use it, have a read on Contino top use cases.
